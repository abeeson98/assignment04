Assignment 04

For the stretch exercise in general: I realize that I am completing this stretch exercise after already working on/completing/submitting Assignment04, which was not recommended. I also completed this without a partner, so the exercise in pulling/pushing from different branches was used by creating two different branches on my own computer called alexa and alexa-two.
For the stretch exercise Part 1: the screenshot can be found in the assignment submitted via canvas.
For part 2: I created 3 branches as listed above (including main), created issues and closed them after committing different portions of stretch04.qmd. Basically, I copied the portions of the assignment already submitted as index.qmd and index.html into a new "stretch04.qmd" file to replicate the process I could have taken should I have done this in the first place.
For part 3: I again used my own branches to push and pull different portions of stretch04.qmd.
For part 4: I used GitHub pages to set up a website, the link to which is provided above!
Thanks
